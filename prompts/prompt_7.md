# Prompt 7
## Input
There is no longer anything ever calling startAutoClicker. Can you fix that?

## Output
Apologies for the oversight. Let's fix that by calling the startAutoClicker function once at the beginning of the script. Add the following line at the end of the script.js file:

```javascript
startAutoClicker();
```

Now, the auto-clicker will start as soon as the game begins. Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the updated game with the auto-clicker functioning correctly.
